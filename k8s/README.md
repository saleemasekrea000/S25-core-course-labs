## K8s Setup and Basic Deployment

Manual deployment was created using the following steps:

```bash
> kubectl create deployment python-app --image=saleemasekrea/app_python:latest
```

This could be verified using `kubectl get deployments`

<details>
<summary>kubectl get deployments output</summary>

```cmd
saleem@saleem-MCLF-XX:~$ kubectl get deployments
NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
python-app   1/1     1            1           15m

```

</details>

Now, to access the deployment, a service was created:

```bash
> kubectl expose deployment python-app --type=LoadBalancer --port=8000
```

This could be verified using `kubectl get services` and `kubectl get pods`:

<details>
<summary>kubectl get services output</summary>

```cmd
saleem@saleem-MCLF-XX:~$ kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP          2d
python-app   LoadBalancer   10.97.205.50   <pending>     8000:32685/TCP   10m
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>kubectl get pods output</summary>

```cmd
saleem@saleem-MCLF-XX:~$ kubectl get pods
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
python-app-77bdd85497-774sf   1/1     Running   0          21m

```

</details>

Running `minikube service python-app` would open the service in the default browser.

- ![Browser window](images/browser.png)

To remove the created pods and services, the following commands were used:

```bash
> kubectl delete service python-app

service "python-app" deleted

> kubectl delete deployment python-app

deployment.apps "python-app" deleted
```

## Declarative Kubernetes Manifests

After creating the `yml` files for the deployment and service, I used `kubectl apply -f <filename>` to create the deployment and service.

- ![Manifest apply](images/Manifest%20apply.png)

Running `kubectl get pods,svc` would shows the created pods and services.

- ![manifest applied](images/pod&svc.png)

This could also be verified on the dashboard by running `minikube dashboard`.

- ![minikube dashboard](images/minikube%20dashboard.png)

Running `minikube service --all` opens the services in the default browser.

## Ingress Controller

The ingress controller was installed and verified using the following commands:

```bash
> minikube addons enable ingress
> kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```

- ![ingress](images/ingress_install.png)

Then the `ingress.yml` file was created and applied.

```bash
> kubectl apply -f ingress.yml

ingress.networking.k8s.io/deployment-ingress created
```

Using `minkube ip`, the IP address can be found-

- ![IP](images/IP.png)

- ![ingress](images/get_ingress.png)

Using `curl --resolve "python.app:80:$( minikube ip )" -i http://python.app`, the app can be accessed.

- ![curl](images/curl.png)

For the go app

- ![curl](images/go_curl.png)

To clean up, the following commands were used:

```bash
> kubectl delete -f ingress.yml

ingress.networking.k8s.io "deployment-ingress" deleted

> kubectl delete -f app_python/deployment.yml

deployment.apps "app-python-deployment" deleted

> kubectl delete -f app_python/service.yml

service "app-python-service" deleted

> kubectl delete -f app_go/deployment.yml

deployment.apps "app-go-deployment" deleted

> kubectl delete -f app_go/service.yml

service "app-go-service" deleted

```
