### Unit Tests

Unit tests are maintained in the `app_service_test.go` file. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
go test -v 
```

To check the code coverage, use the following command:

```bash

go test -cover

```

### CI Workflow

A CI workflow is maintained in the `.github/workflows/go_app.yaml` file. This workflow lints and tests the application,checks code vulnerability using SNYK ,and builds and pushes docker image. Workflow is triggered only if the there is a change in the app_go directory or the workflow file itself.

The CI workflow contains 3 jobs. Each job has a specific set of tasks to perform:

- Build: This job lints and tests the application
- Security: This job checks code vulnerability using SNYK
- Docker: This job builds and pushes the docker image to the Docker Hub. The job is carried out only if the previous jobs are successful.
